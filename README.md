# RomCom  

### Abstract:
We built a romantic comedy book cover application that allows for us to generate new book covers given arrays of data and also to create new book covers using user generated input. Additionally, we have functionality to save covers and view the saved covers in a different display. The display to view saved covers also has interaction -  when you double click any cover it will be removed from the display.

### Context:
Tricia Holmes and I are on our second week of the Turing front end program. To complete this project, we spent roughly 8 hours pair programming to create the complete app functionality.

### Learning Goals:
- Write clean, DRY JavaScript
    - Use a provided class by creating object instances using the new keyword
    - Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
- Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    - Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
- Write code collaboratively
    - Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
    - Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team

### Wins + Challenges:
1. We learned how to use double click as an event handler and subsequently use this knowledge to correctly target and remove the parent element of what was being double clicked.
2. We struggled with the browser defaults with the form submission and ultimately overcame that challenge through experimentation and documentation review.
